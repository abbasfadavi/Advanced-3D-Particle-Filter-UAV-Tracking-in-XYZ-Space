Advanced 3D Particle Filter ‚Äì UAV Tracking in XYZ Space

This project implements an Advanced 3D Particle Filter for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking in three-dimensional space (X‚ÄìY‚ÄìZ).
The goal is to accurately estimate the UAV position using a large number of particles under noisy measurement conditions.

üß† Overview

The algorithm is first modeled and simulated in MATLAB, providing a detailed visualization of the UAV‚Äôs motion, measurement noise, and estimated trajectory.
Then, the same algorithm is efficiently implemented in Vivado HLS, targeting FPGA hardware acceleration.

A comparison between MATLAB and HLS outputs verifies the correctness and performance equivalence of both implementations.
